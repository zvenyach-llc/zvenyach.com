comment = "Your analysis--\"buying an outcome or only buying capacity\"--is good. But if a contract has several defined outcomes (deliverables) that would be useful to the government even if not all are delivered, then each deliverable could be ordered and funded in a different fiscal year to smooth the cost.\nIf the government is only buying capacity, then it is not only a severable service, it is using \"agile\" as a fig leaf for a labor-hour contract."
