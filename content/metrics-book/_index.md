How can I measure whether a software-delivery team is performing well? What should we be tracking in our acquisition organization? What metrics are important in digital-services acquisition? Why should I care?

If you have ever asked any of these questions, the **Digital-Services Acquisition Metrics Manifesto** has you covered.

The Metrics Manifesto touches on one of the hardest topics that a digital-services professional has to consider. Although every organization insists on having metrics and dashboards, it's rare for an organization to have _useful_ metrics or dashboards. This book hopes to change all of that, by explaining some simple logic behind useful metrics and applying them to the topic of digital-services acquisition.

In the Metrics Manifesto, you'll learn about the following topics:

* Why metrics matter
* What makes some metrics “dangerous”
* The key characteristics that make metrics "good"
* The concept of "metrics federalism" that can help your organization set the right metrics
* What metrics are useful in a digital-services acquisition organization

The Metrics Manifesto is written primarily for individuals who work in digital-services acquisition, but can be a helpful guide to anyone who is searching for better metrics in their organization.

I plan to update the book over time and, if you buy the book, you'll get those updates for free. And **if, after reading the Digital-Services Acquisition Metrics Manifesto, you're not 99.98% satisfied, I'll refund your money. No questions asked.**
